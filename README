The Eye Exercise

This project is a simple representation of dynamically changing the styles of an element using javascript. 
We've created and styled divs to project the appearance of two eyes, and using javascript we are dynamically changing the location of the eyeballs.

HOW TO RUN:
After downloading the directory to your machine, simply open index.html and watch the eyeballs follow your cursor simultaneously!

Roadmap of future improvements:
Add more art to the area around the eyes for a nice comedic element.
The eyes get sleepy and start to close after travelling a certain amount.
